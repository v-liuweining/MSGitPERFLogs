    [Issue #3840](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3840)
### Setup

 - Which version of `microsoft/git` are you using? Is it 32-bit or 64-bit?

```
$ git --version --build-options

TestCase1: 
    git version 2.35.3.vfs.0.0
    cpu: x86_64
    built from commit: d34442f3ab072056eab72131c02abcf76b32d827
    sizeof-long: 4
    sizeof-size_t: 8
    shell-path: /bin/sh
    feature: fsmonitor--daemon

TestCase2:
    git version 2.43.0.vfs.0.0
    cpu: x86_64
    built from commit: b7a6ed788a205fb2c0013111d277b4c9d6ab35bd

### Details

 - Which terminal/shell are you running Git from? e.g Bash/CMD/PowerShell/other
    ```
    CMD
    ```
 - What commands did you run to trigger this issue? If you can provide a
   [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
   this will help us understand the issue.

    ```
    git pull
    ```
 - What did you expect to occur after running these commands?

    The completion time of running "git pull" with git version 2.43.0.vfs.0.0 can be close to git version 2.35.3.vfs.0.0.


 - What actually happened instead?

    Since git version 2.36, the execution time of "git pull" has become significantly longer. I tried using the following commands to log the details:

    ```
    set GIT_TRACE2_PERF=1
    set GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS=1
    set GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1
    git pull
    ```

    Git-2.35.3.vfs.0.0-64-bit:
      - Multiple consecutive executions of "git pull," with an average execution time of about 10 seconds.
      - log: [Git-2.35.3.vfs.0.0-64-bit.txt](https://github.com/v-liuweining/MSGitPERFLogs/blob/main/Git-2.35.3.vfs.0.0-64-bit/git_pull_with_GIT_TRACE2_PERF-GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS-GIT_CURL_VERBOSE.txt).
      - git config: [here](https://github.com/v-liuweining/MSGitPERFLogs/blob/main/Git-2.35.3.vfs.0.0-64-bit/git_config_list_show_origin.txt)

    Git-2.43.0.vfs.0.0-64-bit:
      - Multiple consecutive executions of "git pull," with an average execution time of about 100+ seconds.
      - log: [Git-2.43.0.vfs.0.0-64-bit.txt](https://github.com/v-liuweining/MSGitPERFLogs/blob/main/Git-2.43.0.vfs.0.0-64-bit/git_pull_with_GIT_TRACE2_PERF-GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS-GIT_CURL_VERBOSE.txt).
      - git config: [here](https://github.com/v-liuweining/MSGitPERFLogs/blob/main/Git-2.43.0.vfs.0.0-64-bit/git_config_list_show_origin.txt)

    The local repositories used for testing are generated by executing "scalar clone" after installing the corresponding git version.

 - If the problem was occurring with a specific repository, can you specify
   the repository?
